	<h1 id = "p1"><u>Version Control System</u></h1>
<p class ="p">Version control systems are a category of software tools that helps record changes to files by keeping a track of modifications done to the code. Using it, the developers can work together on code and separate 
their tasks through branches.</p>
<p class="p">There can be several branches in a version control system, according to the number of collaborators. The branches maintain individuality as the code changes remain in a specified branch(s).</p>
<p class="p">
Developers can combine the code changes when required. Further, they can view the history of changes, go back to the previous version(s) and use/manage code in the desired fashion.</p>
<h2 id="p2"><u>GIT and GITHUB</u></h2>
<p class ="p">First developed back in 2005, Git is an extremely popular version control system that is at the heart of a wide variety of high-profile projects. Git is installed and maintained on your local system (rather than in the cloud) and gives you a self-contained record of your ongoing programming versions.</p>
<p class ="p">
	Unlike Git, GitHub is exclusively cloud-based. Also unlike Git, GitHub is a for-profit service (although basic repository-hosting features are available at no cost to those who are willing to create a user profile, making GitHub a popular choice for open-source projects).
</p>
<h1 id="p3"><u>GIT Commands</u></h1>

<dl class="p">
	<dt><strong><u>git pull</u> </strong></dt>
	<dd>
updates the local line of development with updates from its remote counterpart. Developers use this command if a teammate has made commits to a branch on a remote, and they would like to reflect those changes in their local environment.</dd>
<dt><strong><u>	git push</u></strong></dt>
	<dd>
	
updates the remote repository with any commits made locally to a branch.
	</dd>
</dt>
<dt><strong><u>git commit</u></strong>
	</dt>
	<dd>
		
Saves the snapshot to the project history and completes the change-tracking process. In short, a commit functions like taking a photo. Anything thatâ€™s been staged with git add will become a part of the snapshot with git commit.
	</dd>
	<dt><strong><u>git fork</u></strong></dt>
	<dd>
		A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.
	</dd>
	</dl>
